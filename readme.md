# Champsim-Cache-Improvements
Adopted strategies to reduce conflict misses at the Last Level Cache
by analyzing and categorizing cache sets based on access and eviction counts into Very Hot, Hot, Cold, and Very Cold.
Optimizations implemented led to a 7% reduction in cache misses, enhancing overall system efficiency and throughput, and
placing the team in the top 1% of performers.
